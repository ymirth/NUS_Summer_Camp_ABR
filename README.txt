For task1
Our model is in abr.py 
SAC is composite of Policynetwork, SoftQnetowrk , and a Replaybuffer to store the state for training

EnvDash is the training environment we made.
And run.py use the Algorithm class to get action
You can use run.py to try the run the ABR.py

the rewards our model estimated are
fix1600 low658 medium 800 high2700
but in the model  we're currently still training ,we get 4100 for high

we didn't train the model completely , so there is much potential space for our model

NOTE: the modelpolicy.data 
modelpolicy.index and ABR.py has to be in the same directory


modelpolicy.data 
modelpolicy.index
store the ABR.py 's model

For task2
we get the mpd file at submit\results\my_other_file
called :low1_dash.mpd
but we didn't have time to seperate the audio and video

For task3
submit\results\my_other_file\public_html\abrï¼šthere is our birule js file called MLBitraterule.js
you can access https://monterosa.d2.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sws2022t4/
